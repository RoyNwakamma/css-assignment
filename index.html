        A team of researchers recently developed an artificial intelligence model
        that can predict which coronavirus variants will likely dominate and cause
        surges. The work was led by Jacob Lemieux, and assistant professor of 
        medicine at Havard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, and 
        Pardis Sabeti, a member at the Broad Institute of MIT and Havard, professor
        of organimsic and evolutionary biology at Havard's Faculty of Arts and 
        Sciences, and of immunology and infectious diseases at the Havard T.H Chan 
        School of Public Health. It also benefits from the work of AI researchers
        Fritz Obermeyer and Martin Jankowiak, who joined the Broad in 2020 from Uber
        AI Labs, where they developed a machine-learning model that can handle 
        massive amounts of data and provided a foundation for the the latest work.
        The Gazette spoke with Lemieux and Sabeti about the new AI machine-learning
        model, called PyR<sub>o</sub>(pie-R-naught) and how it will help in the 
        current pandemic and for diseases to come.<br>
        The clearest prediction that the model made was that, among the omicron 
        sub-lineages, BA.2 was the fittest. At the time that we analyzed the data,
        it was the BA.1(omicron) epidemic and BA.1 was the variant that everyone
        was focused on-in South Africa initially and then just about everywhere
        else in the world. The model made a fairly strong and confident prediction
        that BA.2 was fitter. That was based on BA.2's dynamics in a few locations,
        mainly India and Denmark, which turned out to be quite accurate. Since that 
        time, BA.2 has taken over BA.1 just about everywhere, and BA.4 or 5 are 
        actually sub-lineages of BA.2. That was a vote of confidence in the model's 
        ability to at least forecast dynamics.
